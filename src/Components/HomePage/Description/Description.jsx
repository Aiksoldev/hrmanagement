          Healthcare services and products present distinct challenges when
          compared to other consumer goods and services because it deals with
          health behaviors rather than merely buying behaviors. The healthcare
          centers are about more than just raising awareness and educating
          people; it's also about changing people's perceptions. A changing
          population and their accompanying issues, improvements in research,
          and other external variables all have an impact on the healthcare
          industry.
